# On the contribution of thesis

* `Academic contribution` is now considered less important in defense.
* However, your thesis should contain new elements. 

## What can be new elements?
* What can your thesis add to the knowledge of people around you (vs human being)?
* The new elements do not have to be `great`, `ingenious`, `creative`, `new`, etc. 
* You should provide answers to `research questions`

Why did you pick your topic?

* Wrong answers: 
  * Because you have time
  * Because nobody did it before
  * Because there are many
* Right answer:



## Type of new elements

### 1. New empirical empirical discovery
  * Hypothesis, channels, econometric method, etc

### 2. New theory / model / method / etc
  * There is nothing new under the sun.
  * Most of `new findings` are incremental or build upon existing findings.
  * 

### 1. Replication 
  * Tweak on an existing (established/well-known) research
  * Extension of empirical evidence: China market data, etc
  * Application of theory paper to empirical data
  
### 2. Horse racing / survey paper
  * Extensive summary of existing methods
  * Systematic comparison of existing methods (hypothesis)


### Example:
* [SABR volatility model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABR_volatility_model) is one of the most popular stochastic volatility model to explain volatility smile.
* The original paper provided an approximate formula to quickly compute the Black-Scholes volatility. However, this formula is not very accurate.
* Several improvements have been proposed. Each claim that the method is superior to the original method. However there is no research comparing the new methods.
* So I posted a question on [Quant StachExchange](https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/42307/comparison-of-various-improvements-to-hagans-sabr-formula). No answer. So I proposed this as a thesis topic.

* Drawback: lacks
